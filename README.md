Optimistic, curious and a person who really does the best for the company, this way I can help as much as possible the company I work for and in parallel evolving in the tools and methodologies I like.


### That's what I do

I'm a fullStack developer at Yeah, a small studio that develops an internal app for a car manufacturer, through this experience I had the opportunity to work with php, aws, git and my main focus react native and android.

It was also possible to improve management tools like scrum, kanban and okr's.


### Background

Finishing the computer engineering course and Graduated in Design, after more than ten years working as design, team management  and client management, today I am focused on following in this branch of informatics where I found myself and I have to evolve more every day.

### My targets
- React Native
- Android

### 👋 About Me
Optimistic, curious and a person who really does the best for the company 💚, this way I can help as much as possible the company I work for and in parallel evolving in the tools and methodologies I like.


 ### 💻 That's what I do

I'm a fullStack developer at Yeah, a small studio that develops an internal app for a car manufacturer, through this experience I had the opportunity to work with php, aws, git and my main focus **react native**


My love for react native made me responsible in the current company that I am, for two applications made by me from scratch that help in the day to day of education professionals.
